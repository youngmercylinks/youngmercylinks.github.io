## What is Young Mercy Links?

In 2005, the Institute of the Sisters of Mercy of Australia (now
[ISMAPNG](http://institute.mercy.org.au)) raised concerns at their annual
conference that students who had been volunteering while attending Mercy
schools were finding it difficult to maintain their passion for raising
awareness of social justice issues as well as access to connections for
relevant volunteering activities after graduation. In response, the
Melbourne congregation started a new program---Young Mercy Links---to assist
young adults with a strong sense of social justice in finding volunteering
opportunities after they've left school.

Ten years later, Young Mercy Links (YML) has grown significantly and is
still going strong. Our coordinator, Bernadette Inman, helps to put members
in touch with volunteering opportunities that they might otherwise be unable
to access since leaving school. Together we also present seminars on social
justice issues, helping to raise awareness and support within the community.

## Joining YML
YML is open to all young adults who have left secondary school. If you've
recently graduated and you'd like to support social justice but you don't
know where to start, why don't you come along to one of our events, or [get
in touch](/contact.html) with our coordinator to find out more about joining. If you're
still in high school, you're welcome to attend any of our social justice
evenings and find out more about joining after you graduate.

## YML core values
- We believe in the capacity and generosity of young adults to work for a just
world
- We open ourselves to the experience of working alongside marginalised people
in a volunteer capacity.
- With support and education we enable young people to reflect on their
experience and grow in awareness of social justice issues.
- We offer a point of contact for like-minded friendships and for the
opportunity to link with justice-based networks both locally and
internationally.
